# NLP

This is an assignment for writing a grammar for the Vietnamese language.

Here i have use most out of a python lá»‰brary Natual language tool kit (nltk) to make this to work. 

As you know nltk is the heavy lifting here but it have one minor problem with the feature context free grammar that is not having the function to generate all possible senetences so most of my work is to create this function (fcfg_generate).

The main code is in main.py and you might want to modify the directory for it to work properly
